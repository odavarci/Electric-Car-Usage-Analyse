# Electric-Car-Usage-Analyse

### 1) Analyse Dataset
#### 1-1) Import Dataset:
We imported dataset and add NA values intentionally to add a step for handling NA values to solution.
#### 1-2) Understand basics about dataset:
We look basics like what does dataset look like, number of NA values per column, is there any unnecessary columns.
#### 1-3) Fill NA Values:
At this step we chose different approach to the problem of replacing NA values. Since some columns of dataset are effecting another (ex: every x city in y state), we replaced NA values with other rows needed column (if y is NA, then look other x city rows y value).
#### 1-4) Data Visualization:
We looked for answers of basic questions like "Which brand is mostly preferred by costumers?", "Which model is mostly preferred by costumers?", "Which model offers the longest range?", "Which electric car model is the most expensive one?" and analysed correlation matrix.
